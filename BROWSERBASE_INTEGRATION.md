# Modified Browserbase Integration

This document describes how the Web UI engine selects and uses a modified version of the Browserbase browser control system, which operates locally without requiring the Browserbase cloud service.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Components:**
   - Open Operator Frontend (sends tasks via MCP)
   - Web UI Backend (processes tasks, selects browser method)
   - Modified Browserbase SDK (local browser control)
   - Bridge Server (session management)

2. **Flow:**
   - User submits task through Open Operator UI
   - Task is sent via MCP to Web UI
   - Web UI processes task and selects "Browserbase" method
   - Web UI sends commands to Modified Browserbase SDK
   - SDK controls browser using local Playwright
   - Results flow back through chain to UI

## Modified Browserbase SDK

### Key Differences from Cloud Version
- Uses **local** Playwright for browser control
- No dependency on Browserbase cloud services
- No API keys or cloud authentication needed
- Runs browser instances locally

### Features
- Session management
- Navigation controls
- Element interaction
- Content extraction
- Screenshot capture

## Integration Points

### Web UI Selection
- Web UI engine receives task via MCP
- Engine processes task requirements
- Selects "Browserbase" as execution method
- Delegates commands to Modified SDK

### Browser Control
- SDK receives commands from Web UI
- Uses local Playwright installation
- Controls browser directly
- Returns results to Web UI

### Resource Management
- SDK can request additional resources from Web UI if needed
- Manages browser instances locally
- Handles session lifecycle

## Communication Flow

```
User Action
    → Open Operator UI
    → MCP Request to Web UI
    → Web UI Selects Browserbase
    → Commands to Modified SDK
    → Local Browser Control
    → Results Back to Web UI
    → MCP Response to Open Operator
    → UI Update
```

## Important Notes

1. **No Cloud Dependency**
   - This integration uses NO Browserbase cloud services
   - All browser control is local
   - No external API calls or authentication

2. **Local Resources**
   - Browser instances run on local machine
   - Playwright handles browser automation
   - Resources managed locally

3. **Configuration**
   - No Browserbase API keys needed
   - Local configuration only
   - System paths and ports setup

## Setup Requirements

1. **Local Dependencies**
   - Playwright installation
   - Chrome/Chromium browser
   - Node.js environment

2. **Configuration**
   - Port settings
   - Directory paths
   - Environment variables

## Development Notes

### Adding Features
1. **In Web UI**
   - Add new browser command handlers
   - Update browser selection logic
   - Implement result processing

2. **In Modified SDK**
   - Add new browser control functions
   - Implement Playwright commands
   - Add error handling

### Testing
- Verify browser control flow
- Test command execution
- Validate result handling
- Check resource management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Browser Control**
   - Check Playwright installation
   - Verify browser processes
   - Monitor system resources

2. **Integration**
   - Verify Web UI selection
   - Check command flow
   - Monitor result handling

### Debug Steps
1. Enable debug logging
2. Monitor component communication
3. Check browser processes
4. Verify command execution

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced browser control
- Additional automation features
- Improved resource management
- Extended command support
